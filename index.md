### Introduction 

	
&emsp;For our analysis project, we analyzed the relationship between regular-season playing time distributions and final rankings of WNBA teams. Our goal is to determine if there is a specific method of determining playing time that is the most successful. Do successful teams only play their best players the majority of the game, or do they utilize their entire bench and evenly distribute the load? We aim to determine if any successful playing time patterns exist and visualize them if they do. 

&emsp;The data used in this project is taken from the WNBA Statistics page, the official website for all of the league’s statistics. Our goal was to look at data from the past 5 seasons (2020-2024) which required building a dataset of our own. We had access to data sorted by individual season of every player's average per-game statistics. To begin, we downloaded each of the 5 sets of regular season data and added it to a separate sheet in an Excel workbook. Then we read each season in Colab and created individual dataframes. To each data frame, we added a column for the respective year. This was helpful later when we merged the data sets. The next step was to add the rankings that each player’s respective team finished at the end of the season. Using data from ESPN, we added the final team rankings to each dataset for each player. We then proceeded to merge the data frames to have one large dataset from 2020 to 2024. Finally, we got rid of some excess statistics columns that we did not need for our analysis to keep our data as small and as workable as possible. The process was repeated for playoff data. 

&emsp;The first part of our analysis project was constructing the dataset to be usable in the way we wanted. The second part was to look at the distribution of average playing time for each team across 5 years and see if we could detect any successful patterns both during the regular season and playoffs. We created a graph for each WNBA team with 5 distributions representing the 5 years observed. Each graph has average playing time on the x-axis and density on the y-axis. The density represents how many times a playing time was observed among players in the team. We included the final rank the team ended the season with and commented on any patterns we observed. Additionally, the playoff distributions for the teams who eventually won the championship are commented on. We also created plots of the 5 teams who finished first, last, and became champions each year and looked for patterns in their average playing time per game distributions.
